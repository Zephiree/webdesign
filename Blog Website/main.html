                <p>The second week is emulating a whole page from a website and I figured I just do the rest of the page I used for last week’s exercise. The only problems I encountered with this is a lot of coding is for positioning things correctly and some I just have to set static values which means it won’t be responsive. Overall, not too difficult because I also picked a simpler page. This exercise is more in terms of CSS rather than HTML. </p>

            <h3>Week 8</h3>
                <p>Week 8 is all about grid layouts in flexbox, as I understand it is where flexboxes can only be responsive across horizontally a grid can be responsive both vertical and horizontally. I struggled with this a lot partly because I don’t quite how understand the fields for the grid’s CSS properties. I managed to do it in the end but for some reason the first box is wonky even though it’s the same in terms of properties with every other div. </p>

Yui and I is in charge of the design (the look) whereas Milan, Rielle and Lucy is in charge of the coding (technical aspect). However, that doesn’t mean the code team will be doing nothing in the initial steps, they just do less and then when it comes to coding me and Yui will do less to balance it out.</p>

                <p>Week 21 focuses on finalizing the blog by adding extra functionalities for bonus brownie points! Things such as opacity changes on hover, clicking on image to open an external tab of the original size image, and implementing media queries to remove the image once the browser size decreases past a certain amount is to improve that UX quality. This week the group project is also doing preparations for the presentation and getting ready to show off the finished product.</p>
